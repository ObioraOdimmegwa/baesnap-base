                                    <li class="rbullet">Fan Payments are exclusive of VAT, which shall be added at the current rate as applicable to Fan Payments.</li> <br>

                                    <li class="rbullet">To be able to enter into a Fan/Creator Transaction with a particular Creator, you must first add a payment card to your account and then click the 'Subscribe' button on the relevant Creator's profile.</li> <br>

All Fan Payments will be charged in currency determined by us. Your payment card provider may charge you currency conversion fees. We do not have control over currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your payment card provider or bank and we and our subsidiary companies will not be responsible for paying any charges or fees imposed by your payment card provider or bank.</li> <br>

                                    <li class="rbullet">If you choose to provide details of two or more payment cards, then if you try to make a Fan Payment from the first card and the card is rejected for any reason, then the other payment card will be used to collect the full Fan Payment.</li> <br>

                                        The payment provider will take:

                                    <li class="rbullet">Apart from free-trial Subscriptions, all Subscriptions to a Creator's profile will automatically renew at the end of the relevant subscription period, except if your payment card is declined, the subscription price for the Subscription has increased, or you have turned off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile. This means that if you want to stop subscribing to a Creator's profile and paying continuing monthly subscription charges, you will need to turn off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile.</li> <br>

                                    <li class="rbullet">If you cancel a Subscription you will continue to be permitted to view the relevant Creator's Content until the end of the subscription period in which you cancelled, after which no further payments will be taken from your payment card in respect of subscriptions to that Creator's profile (unless you choose to pay for a new Subscription to that Creator’s profile), and you will no longer be able to view the relevant Creator's Content.</li> <br>

                                    <li class="rbullet">You agree that you will not make unjustified requests for a refund in respect of any Fan/Creator Transaction or tip to a Creator, or unjustified chargeback requests of your payment card provider in relation to any Fan/Creator Transaction or tip to a Creator. If we consider that any request for a refund or chargeback request was made by you in bad faith, we have the right to suspend or delete your User account.</li> <br>

                                        You can prepay an amount on Baesnap (known as "Wallet Credits") which you can later use to make Fan Payments. Purchases on Baesnap cannot be divided - if you attempt a purchase that costs more than the total amount of your remaining Wallet Credits, your payment card will be charged the full amount for that purchase. Wallet Credits are subject to a maximum amount as determined by us from time to time. Interest will not accrue on Wallet Credits. Wallet Credits are non-refundable, which means that you are not entitled to a refund of any unused Wallet Credits.

                                 If we suspend your User account in accordance with our rights under the Terms of Service, then any Fan Payments which would otherwise have fallen due during the period of suspension of your User account will be suspended during the period of the suspension of your User account.
